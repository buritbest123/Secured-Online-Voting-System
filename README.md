# Online Voting System 🗳️💻

This project implements an **e-Voting system** designed to securely simulate an online voting environment. It incorporates robust features such as **TCP socket programming**, synchronized **multithreading** to handle multiple clients, and **voter authentication** to prevent repeated votes and ensure election integrity. 🔒

## Features 🌟

- **🔑 Secure Authentication:** Ensures that each voter is authenticated before voting.
- **❌ Repeat Voting Prevention:** Each voter can only cast their vote once.
- **📊 Voter and Candidate Data Management:** Stores voter and candidate information securely using CSV files.
- **🤝 Concurrent Client Handling:** Uses synchronized threads to handle multiple voting clients concurrently without interference.
- **🧑‍⚖️ Admin and Voter Interfaces:** Separate login interfaces for admin and voters to manage and participate in elections respectively.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Tkinter for the GUI interface 🖼️
- Socket programming for TCP connections 📡
- Subprocess for OS-level command execution 🖥️
